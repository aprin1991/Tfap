            The distinctive feature of the new technology is the use of high-ash
            carbonaceous raw materials, which is a ready-made natural briquette
            (mono-mix), where favourable combinations contain compounds of
            silicon and and solid carbon the amount of which is sufficient for
            reduction processes and coke addition are not required.

            Raw materials costs for smelting FeSiAl are over 50% lower, than
            those for FeSi75 only due to use of sub-standard raw materials which
            traditionally go to dumps. And cost of production of FeSiAl is 25 -
            35% lower in comparison to cost of production of FeSi75.

            The chosen technology for the production of ferro-silicon-aluminum
            is currently the most effective and beneficial in terms of
            technology and economics. The basing of technology on the use of
            high-ash carbonaceous raw materials related to industrial wastes as
            well as its large reserves open up great prospects for the
            production of complex silicon-aluminum alloys.

            The new technology makes it possible to produce a whole group of
            complex alloys based on ferro-silicon-aluminum with the addition of
            alloying elements (vanadium, boron, rare earth metals) and non-metal
            inclusions modifiers (calcium, barium, strontium).
